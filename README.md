This password generator creates a random string of characters (based on a specified pool of character categories), given a list of parameters specified by the user upon selecting the button. These parameters include the following:
* character length
* character category
    * majuscule alphabet
    * miniscule alphabet
    * numerals
    * special characters

Certain restrictions for each field are set: (1) a positive integer inclusively between 8 and 128 characters must be given for character length; and (2) at least one character category must be selected.

The default HTML and CSS were used and unmodified.
